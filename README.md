# Roball-silentaim-method-Fullcourt-method
I'll be teaching how to make your own silentaim in roball games.
I apologize if my explanation is really vague, english is not really my first language <3.

1. Use a Remote spy to see the arguments passed through the Remote Event.
  Extra: Prefer using SimpleSpy(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/78n/SimpleSpy/main/SimpleSpySource.lua) or use Hydroxide Hub (https://github.com/Upbolt/Hydroxide)

2. Anaylize the arguments. It might look like something like this.

3. The arguments are usually the direction of your mouse, Or sometimes it could have the Power of the ball like in my example or sometimes even a randomized string.


4. Use darkdex to discover what goal name is. (Its usually something weird or its literaly called "Goal" LOL), It might look like something like this.

5. Now for the coding shit :/, Start by making Variables for example.

6. Make a for loop and insert the goal inside a table, for example.

7. Make a function to check for the closest goal near you.

8. Now for the fun part, firing the remote with args <3, I recommend using a function just in case you wana make it a Jump to shoot, Press x to shoot or whatever.

Optional Fullcourt method:
1. If remote event have a Power Argument than a fullcourt is most likely possible.

2. This is how it could look like

3. This won't obviously mean you'll be able to shoot everywhere LOL its just for a certain position, unless you have that much time on your hands and you make a whole functional fullcourt silentaim LOL.

thats pretty much it <3.
